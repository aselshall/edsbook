    "You are familiar with the first two methods. I am adding the third method to make you curious. We will learn the if condition in the next lesson. But you are probably wondering what is this `%` ? The `%` operator in python is the modulus operator. It returns the remainder when the left operand is divided by the right operand. In the context of `if value % 2 == 0`, it is checking if the variable `value` is even. Here is the breakdown: `value % 2` calculates the remainder when `value` is divided by 2, and `value % 2 == 0` checks if the remainder is equal to 0, which means that `value` is divisible evenly by 2.  So, `if value % 2 == 0` is a common way to test for even numbers.\n"
