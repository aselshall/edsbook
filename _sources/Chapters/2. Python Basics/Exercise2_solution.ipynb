    "According to [New Trader U: 3 Low-Effort Ways To Become A Millionaire](https://www.newtraderu.com/2023/05/07/3-low-effort-ways-to-become-a-millionaire/), Standard and Poor's 500 index fund (S&P 500) tracks the stock performance of 500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the US. The average historical rate an investor can expect long-term on S&P 500 is 8% annual compounded growth. The formula is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "FV = PM * \\frac{[(1 + r)^{nt} – 1]}{r} \n",

    "Where:      \n",
    "FV:  Future value of the investment (e.g., \\\\$1,000,000)     \n",
    "PM: Monthly investment amount (e.g., \\\\$300)     \n",
    "r:   Monthly interest rate (e.g. 0.64%)     \n",
    "n:   Number of times the interest is compounded per year (i.e., 12 for monthly compounding)     \n",
    "t:   Number of years (e.g., 20 years)   \n",
