    "You are analyzing a big dataset about water quality in a river based on  nutrient levels (total nitrogen and total phosphorus), oxygen availability for aquatic life (dissolved oxygen), and bacterial contamination (fecal coliform bacteria). High nutrient levels and low dissolved oxygen levels indicate ecosystem imbalance and stress. High nutrient levels of nitrogen and phosphorus lead to algal blooms and eutrophication, depleting oxygen in the water. Dissolved oxygen is also necessary for fish, macroinvertebrates, and other aquatic life to breathe. Presence of fecal coliform bacteria indicates contamination from human or animal waste. This poses health risks to humans and animals when using the water for recreation or drinking.\n",
