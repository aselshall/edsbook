The Greenshields model is a fundamental traffic flow model that describes the relationship between the traffic density (k) and the speed of the traffic (v). According to this model, the speed decreases linearly with the increase of traffic density until it reaches a maximum density where the speed is zero.\n",

    "It is not only raining or not raining, but the rainfall intensity could also have an impact. There is no universal relationship between rainfall intensity and the reduction in maximum travel speed because it depends on various factors such as road conditions, vehicle characteristics, driver behavior, visibility, and local regulations. We can use big data and machine learning to develop a relationship for roads of interest. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we can create a simplified model that assumes a linear relationship between rainfall intensity and a reduction in maximum speed. Let's say that for every mm/hour increase in rainfall intensity, the maximum speed is reduced by a certain percentage. To keep things simple, we can introduce `speed_reduction_factor` to the maximum speed based on the rainfall intensity:\n",
