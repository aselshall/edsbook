    "Why? In Jupyter Notebooks or IPython environments, when you import a module, the imported module is cached in memory. If you make changes to the module (like adding a new function), simply re-importing the module may not reflect the changes immediately. This is because the kernel retains the previous version of the module in memory. Restarting the kernel is a way to clear the memory and reload all the modules, ensuring that any changes made to the module are applied. To do this, go to `Kernel` menu and select `Restart kernel` and you are good to go."

    "#### 3.3.2 Poor names when renaming on import\n",
    "When importing popular Python packages, there are some conventional short names that are commonly used across the Python community. These conventions are not strict rules, but following them can improve code readability and make your code more consistent with the broader Python ecosystem. Here are some common short names for popular python packages:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import seaborn as sns\n",
    "import sklearn\n",
    "import tensorflow as tf\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you want to make the module name shorter on import, pick a reasonable abbreviation.\n",
    "For instance, `import matplotlib as m` could be confusing, especially if you're also using `import math as m` in other Jupyter notebooks or script files.\n",
    "Similarly, `import matplotlib as math` is perfectly OK syntax in python, but bound to cause a world of trouble.\n",
    "Remember, people need to be able to read and understand the code you write, keep it simple and logical."

    "What does PEP 8 say about imports? According to good coding practices described in <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#imports\">PEP 8</a>, we should always import modules at the top of the file. In this lesson, we are demonstrating how to import different modules along the way, but in general it would be better to import requried modules as the very first thing. PEP 8 refers more to traditional script files, but we can apply the guideline to Jupyter Notebook files by placing our imports the first code cell in the Jupyter Notebook.\n"

    "\n",
    "It's also good to be aware of [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), the package installer for python. [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is another package installer for python that provides package management system. For example, with Mamba you can list installed package names and versions using the `mamba list` command. Pip and Mamba are often used for similar purposes, but the key difference is that pip is used for installing packages written in python, while Mamba handles packages that might also contain code written in other languages. \n",
