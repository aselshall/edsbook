    "## Overview\n",
    "In this course we will use Python with [Jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/), which is an open-source interactive development environment (IDE) that facilitates data science and scientific computing in Python through a web-based interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install Python using different methods:\n",
    "- Anaconda (*not very much recommended*):\n",
    "  Installing Python using [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/index.html) provides a streamlined and comprehensive approach, bundling not only Python but also popular data science libraries and tools. [This video](https://youtu.be/ozTSqhU9Hek?si=cGzNRATmPOPsoLCg) for example shows how to install Python with Anaconda, the different tools that Anaconda provides, how to create a shortcut for jupyterl lab, and how to get started.\n",
    "  - Pros: It simplifies the setup process, ensuring compatibility among packages.\n",
    "  - Cons: Too much time and too much space needed and you will get a lot of tools that you will not use for this course\n",
    "- Miniconda (*recommended*):\n",
    "  - Pros: Light weight version of Anaconda\n",
    "  - Cons: You would need to do few extra steps as shown in this tutorial\n",
    "- Installing Python manually (*not recommended*):\n",
    "  - Pros: Allows for more control over specific versions\n",
    "  - Cons: Requires much additional effort in managing dependencies and configurations\n",
    "- FGCU AppsAnywhere (*not recommended*):\n",
    "  If you cannot install Python on your machine, [FGCU appsanywhere](https://www.fgcu.edu/its/appsanywhere/) has Anaconda.\n",
    "  - Pros: You do not need to install anything and you can use Jupyterlab on the cloud\n",
    "  - Cons: Many features such as adding Jupyterlab extensions will be disabled; old version of Python 3.8x; can create sync issues with OneDrive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows you how to:\n",
    "- install Miniconda that will install Python for you\n",
    "- use Miniconda to install JupyterLab\n",
    "- create a JupyterLab shortcut"

    "\n",
    "You can easily install Python through Minoconda from [Minconda webpage](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html). You can find more information at [GeoPython - Installing Python](https://geo-Python-site.readthedocs.io/en/latest/course-info/installing-miniconda.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Create Anaconda Prompt Shortcut:** Drag Anaconda Prompt (Miniconda3) from Start Menu to Desktop, which will create an Anaconda Prompt (Miniconda3) shortcut. You can check that by clicking on it and then typing `jupyter lab` which will launch JupyterLab.\n",
